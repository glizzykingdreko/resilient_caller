# Resilient Caller

Welcome to the Resilient Caller, a Python package that will revolutionize the way you handle retries and exceptions in your code. Developed with love and passion, this package aims to make your life easier and your code more elegant by providing a customizable wrapper to retry function calls with custom logic.
